All seven mergings were successfull.

We have been observing which generation did converge to the correct solution only in the case of mergings number 4,5, and 7. 
The merging number 4 did converge in 2 iterations! 
The merging number 5 in 4 iterations.
And merging number 7 in 29 cases which was a outlier because other mergings had to be successful not later than in the 20th iteration as we always seen the correct merging as we turned our attention from writing the plotting scripts to the ongoing testing.
